NOTE: This is experimental software meant for advanced users; assume nothing
works, and you may be pleasantly surprised. And when it breaks, you get to
keep both pieces.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
This module requires Drupal 6.x and PHP 5.2.x (or newer).

INSTALLATION
------------

  1. Copy all the module files into a subdirectory called modules/rdf/
     under your Drupal installation directory.

  2. Go to Administer >> Site building >> Modules and enable the RDF API
     and RDF DB modules.

  3. Go to Administer >> Site configuration >> RDF settings to review and
     change the configuration options to your liking.

  4. Optionally, you may wish to install the ARC2 library in order to enable
     support for more RDF formats and for SPARQL queries. To install,
     download the latest version of the library from:

       <http://arc.semsol.org/download>

     ...and unzip it to modules/rdf/vendor/arc2/ under the Drupal directory.

  5. Also, if you have installed ARC2, you may wish to enable the
     bundled RDF Export and RDF Import modules. To do this, go back to
     Administer >> Site building >> Modules.

  6. (See README.txt for information on submitting bug reports.)
